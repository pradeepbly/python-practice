What are the potential security concerns or best practices to keep in mind when designing and configuring a VPC?
Explain the process and benefits of implementing VPC Flow Logs. How can they be used for monitoring and troubleshooting?
What is AWS VPC Flow Analyzer, and how does it help in analyzing network traffic flows in your VPC?
Discuss the options for connecting a VPC to an on-premises network. How would you choose between using a VPN connection or Direct Connect?
Explain the purpose of Route Tables in a VPC and how they are used to control traffic between subnets and external networks.
Can you detail the steps involved in migrating resources from one VPC to another? What challenges might arise during this process?
Explain the concept of AWS Transit Gateway. How does it simplify network connectivity across multiple Amazon VPCs and on-premises networks?
What are the key benefits of using AWS Transit Gateway compared to traditional VPC peering and VPN connections for large-scale network architectures?
Describe the process of setting up and configuring a Transit Gateway. What are the essential components and steps involved?
How does route propagation work in AWS Transit Gateway? What are the different methods for propagating routes, and when would you use each method?
Explain how Transit Gateway Network Manager can be used to visualize and monitor network connectivity across multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.
What is the purpose of Transit Gateway Route Tables? How do they differ from VPC Route Tables, and how are they used to control traffic within the Transit Gateway?
Can you elaborate on the options available for connecting Transit Gateway to on-premises networks? What are the considerations and steps involved in setting up these connections?
Describe the scenarios in which you would use Transit Gateway Multicast and Transit Gateway Inter-Region Peering. What are the benefits and use cases for each?
How can you achieve high availability and fault tolerance when using Transit Gateway across multiple Availability Zones and regions?
Explain how Transit Gateway integrates with security and routing features, such as Network ACLs, Security Groups, and VPN connections.
Discuss the challenges and considerations when migrating an existing network architecture to use Transit Gateway. What are the potential pitfalls to watch out for?
How does AWS Transit Gateway support integration with Route 53 for DNS resolution and private hosted zones within connected VPCs?
Describe the use of Transit Gateway Attachments and Associations. How do they allow for flexible connectivity between VPCs and on-premises networks?
Can you outline the steps involved in troubleshooting connectivity issues within an AWS Transit Gateway environment? What tools and resources would you use?
What is an AWS VPC Endpoint, and why might you consider using it in your VPC architecture?
Describe the differences between Gateway VPC Endpoints and Interface VPC Endpoints. In which scenarios would you prefer one type over the other?
Explain the process of creating and configuring a VPC Endpoint for services like Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. What are the essential steps involved?
How does a VPC Endpoint enhance security and reduce exposure to the public internet when accessing AWS services?
Can you outline the considerations and steps for allowing cross-account access to a VPC Endpoint? What are the security implications?
Discuss the interaction between VPC Endpoint policies and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. How do they work together to control access?
Explain the concept of PrivateLink and how it's related to VPC Endpoints. How does it enable private communication between VPCs and AWS services?
What are the potential challenges and best practices for managing VPC Endpoints at scale, especially in environments with numerous VPCs and endpoints?
Can you elaborate on how VPC Endpoints handle DNS resolution for supported AWS services? How does this differ from the default DNS behavior in a VPC?
Describe the role of Route Tables in routing traffic to VPC Endpoints. How do you ensure proper routing and communication between instances and endpoints?
In terms of monitoring and troubleshooting, what tools and resources are available for diagnosing connectivity issues with VPC Endpoints?
How do you handle versioning and updates of VPC Endpoint policies? Can you explain a strategy to ensure minimal disruption while maintaining security?
Discuss the considerations and steps involved in moving resources from using an Internet Gateway to using VPC Endpoints for accessing AWS services.
Explain how AWS PrivateLink can be used to create custom endpoints for third-party services. What are the benefits and use cases for such an approach?
What are the implications of using VPC Peering in combination with VPC Endpoints? How can you ensure secure communication in such scenarios?
